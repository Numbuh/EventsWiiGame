# Quick Start Guide - Pokemon Event Archive Wii Game

## What You've Got

A complete Wii homebrew game with:
- âœ… Animated start screen with "Press A to Play"
- âœ… Main menu with 5 interactive buttons
- âœ… Gen 1, 2, and 3 Event information screens
- âœ… Event Details information page
- âœ… Wiimote pointer controls

## Building (One-Time Setup)

### Step 1: Install DevkitPro
```bash
# macOS
brew install devkitpro-pacman

# Then install Wii libraries
sudo dkp-pacman -S wii-dev grrlib libogc libfat-ogc
```

### Step 2: Set Environment Variables
Add to `~/.zshrc`:
```bash
export DEVKITPRO=/opt/devkitpro
export DEVKITPPC=/opt/devkitpro/devkitPPC
export PATH=$DEVKITPRO/tools/bin:$PATH
```

Apply:
```bash
source ~/.zshrc
```

### Step 3: Build
```bash
cd "/Users/adam/Desktop/Event wii game"
./build.sh
```

This creates `event_wii_game.dol` - your Wii game!

- Install missing libs: `sudo dkp-pacman -S grrlib libogc`

**Black screen on Wii?**
- Check SD card is FAT32
- Verify file is named `boot.dol`
- Update Homebrew Channel

**Wiimote doesn't work?**
- Check IR sensor bar is plugged in
- Resync Wiimote
- Replace batteries

## About WBFS Format

WBFS is for full Wii disc games, not homebrew apps. This game runs via:
- **Homebrew Channel** (recommended) - uses .dol format
- **wiiload** (network) - for development
- **USB loaders** (advanced) - can load .dol files

The .dol file IS the final game format for homebrew.

## What's Next?

You can customize:
- Event content in `source/main.cpp`
- Add images/graphics (see GRRLIB docs)
- Add sound effects (see asndlib)
- Create more screens

See `INSTALL.md` for detailed instructions.
See `README.md` for technical details.
